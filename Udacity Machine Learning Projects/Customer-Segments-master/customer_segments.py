# ## Getting Started
# 
# In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
# 
# The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.
# 
# Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.

# In[1]:

# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import renders as rs
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Show matplotlib plots inline (nicely formatted in the notebook)
get_ipython().magic(u'matplotlib inline')

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print "Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape)
except:
    print "Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?"


# ## Data Exploration
# In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.
# 
# Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.

# In[2]:

# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())


# ### Implementation: Selecting Samples
# To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.

# In[3]:

# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
indices = [68,301,311]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print "Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:"
display(samples)


# ### Question 1
# Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  
# *What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?*  
# **Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, and retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant.

# In[ ]:




# The first sample could be a cafe since it buys lots of milk relative to other things and a fair amount of delicatessen products. The mean for milk purchases is 5796 and so the first sample purchases over 25% more than the mean and is in the top 25% of purchasers - which is something a cafe would do. The second sample could be a grocery store since it buys a large amount of everything and looks to need lots of detergents_paper (way above even the 75th percentile.). the second sample buys in the top 25% of grocery purchases as well which indicates it is a large grocery store. The third could be a market that specializes in fresh produce. It is in the bottom 25% for delicatessen and detergents_paper but in the top 25% for fresh food purchases.

# ### Implementation: Feature Relevance
# One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
#  - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
#    - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
#  - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
#  - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.

# In[59]:

# TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
new_data = data.drop('Frozen',axis=1)
print 'data', data
print new_data
target=data.columns[-3]
target_var=data[target]
print data

# TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets using the given feature as the target
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data,target_var, test_size=0.25, random_state=1)

# TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=0)
regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)

# TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
score = regressor.score(X_test,y_test)
print score


# ### Question 2
# *Which feature did you attempt to predict? What was the reported prediction score? Is this feature is necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?*  
# **Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data.

# **Answer:** I attempted to predict the amount spent on frozen food per customer based on their spending habits in the other categories. The R^2 score is negative (-0.696550018302) which means the model does not fit the data well. Because the other features can not be used to predict this category, it is likely that this feature is relevant to predicting customers spending habits.

# ### Visualize Feature Distributions
# To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.

# In[60]:

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Question 3
# *Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? How is the data for those features distributed?*  
# **Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? 

# **Answer:** Yes, one pair of features that correlates well is grocery and detergents_paper which appears to have a strong linear correlation. On the other hand, the feature "Frozen" appears to be less rigidly correlated but does seem to have a right-skewed distribution with delicatessen,detergents, milk, fresh and grocery. Most points lie to the left of the graph indicating that the median is lower than the mean (right skewed). The weak correlation confirms my thoughts that the feature is actually relevant to the question. 

# ## Data Preprocessing
# In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

# ### Implementation: Feature Scaling
# If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying a logarithm scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
#  - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying a logrithm scaling. Again, use `np.log`.

# In[4]:

# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
log_samples = np.log(samples)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');


# ### Observation
# After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).
# 
# Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.

# In[5]:

# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)


# ### Implementation: Outlier Detection
# Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
#  - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
#  - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
#  - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.
# 
# **NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
# Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.

# In[8]:

# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values
for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],25)
    print Q1
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature],75)
    print Q3
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    step =1.5*(Q3-Q1)
    print 'step', step
   
    
    # Display the outliers
    print "Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature)
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = [154,65,128,75,66]

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)


# ### Question 4
# *Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? Should these data points be removed from the dataset? If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.* 

# **Answer:** Yes, the data points 154,65,128,75 and 66 are outliers for more than one of the features. This suggests these customers may be a particularly small or specialized customers and so should be removed in order to not skew the analysis. Because they are outliers in more than one category, it is likely that their inclusion may skew the analysis because they might not fit into any more general pattern within the customers.

# ## Feature Transformation
# In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.

# ### Implementation: PCA
# 
# Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[9]:

# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=6)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the sample log-data using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = rs.pca_results(good_data, pca)

print pca.explained_variance_ratio_


# ### Question 5
# *How much variance in the data is explained* ***in total*** *by the first and second principal component? What about the first four principal components? Using the visualization provided above, discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.*  
# **Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the indivdual feature weights.

# **Answer:** the first two principle components account for about 71.894% of the total variance of the data. The first 4 components account for 93.12% of the variance of the data. Based on the first dimension, we can see that the purchase of detergents_paper is generally accompanied by the purchase of grocery and milk and delicatessen, and is negatively correlated with fresh and frozen. The largest weight is placed on detergents_paper and so this demesion could be characterize by a large retail store or grocery store customer. Becuase this is the first principle component, can say that 45% of the difference between customers can be explained by whether they purchase fresh and frozen or whether they purchase the other 4 features more. Similar reasoning can be applied to the remaining dimensions. The first four principal components then indicate four ways in which we can separate cutomers. Dimension 2 is characterized by a large weight on fresh followed by delicatessen and frozen. This could be representative of some kind of fresh food market. The 3rd dimension is characterized by a large weight on fresh (negative) and on delicatessen (positive). this dimension is best indicative of customer spending on premade products like frozen and delicatessen. The 4th dimension has high weighting on frozen and a large negative weighting on delicatessen. This could be indicative of customers spending on ready made meals and other frozen products. The 5th dimension has high weight on detergents and high negative weight on milk. This is customers that spend on retail goods. the last dimension has high weight on milk and low weight on grocery. This could be indicative of a cafe type establishment.

# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

# In[10]:

# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))


# ### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
# When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data — in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the reuslts to `reduced_data`.
#  - Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.

# In[11]:

# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
pca.fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the sample log-data using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])


# ### Observation
# Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.

# In[12]:

# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))


# ## Clustering
# 
# In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

# ### Question 6
# *What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?*

# **Answer:** K-means is one of the simplest alogrithms to run because you need only to select a number of clusters. For this reason it is fast and computationally inexpensive. GMM differs from K-means in that it does not assign points to clusters with 100% probability. Instead, it assigns points to clusters with differeing probabilities which means that points can belong to more than one cluster. GMM is much more flexible than k-means. For this problem, I will use k-means due to the simplicity of the algorithm and because I would like customers to fall into only one cluster so that I have a concrete answer for how best to market to that customer..etc

# ### Implementation: Creating Clusters
# Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
#  - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
#  - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
#  - Import sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
#    - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.

# In[18]:

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# TODO: Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data 
clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
clusterer.fit(reduced_data)

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point
preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data)

# TODO: Find the cluster centers
centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_

# TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point
sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)

# TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen
score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds, metric='euclidean')
print score


# ### Question 7
# *Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?* 

# ### **Answer:** 2:0.426, 3:0.397, 4:0.331, 5:0.351, 6:0.365. 2 clusters has the highest score

# ### Cluster Visualization
# Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 

# In[19]:

# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
rs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)


# ### Implementation: Data Recovery
# Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.
# 
# In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
#  - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
#  - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.
# 

# In[129]:

# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)


# ### Question 8
# Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project. *What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?*  
# **Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`.

# **Answer:** It appears that the two cluster represent very different customer segments. Cluster 0 could be attributed to smaller establishments - things like cafes, markets, restaurants...etc, that do not need to provide lots of groceries or detergents_paper but do provide fresh food, milk as well as frozen products and delicatessen products. it appears these places spend below the mean on fresh and almost in the bottom 25% on milk, detergents, deli and grocery although not quite. They spend in the bottom 25% on milk. These low values compared to the means indicate that they are small establishments. Cluster 1 shows much higher spending across all categories especially grocey and detergents-paper and fresh, where they are in the top 25% of spender. I would attribute this cluster to larger establishments like grocery stores and retail stores which would buy all of the categories in large numbers.

# ### Question 9
# *For each sample point, which customer segment from* ***Question 8*** *best represents it? Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*
# 
# Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.

# In[130]:

# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print "Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred


# **Answer:**
# 
# My initial predictions of a cafe for sample point 0 fits with the prediciton of cluster 0 since it is a smaller establishment that wouldnt need huge amounts of groceries...etc. Similarly, my prediction for sample 2 fits with cluster 0 as well. The prediction for sample 1 (grocery store) also fits into the predicted cluster (1) which I attributed to larger establishments like grocery stores!

# ## Conclusion

# In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

# ### Question 10
# Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. *How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would reach positively to the change in delivery service?*  
# **Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

# **Answer:** The distributor should only perform the test on one cluster at a time - since these customers are supposed to be highly similar, which will allow the distributor to be more confident in the result of the A/B. If he did the test on the whole data set, then likely, the difference in the test results could be due to some other factor.

# ### Question 11
# Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
# *How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the* ***customer segment*** *data?*  
# **Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

# **Answer:** The distributor could use a supervised learner which would take into account the spending data and produce a label (the label being the cluster that the new client falls into).

# ### Visualizing Underlying Distributions
# 
# At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.
# 
# Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.

# In[20]:

# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
rs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)


# ### Question 12
# *How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?*

# **Answer:** The clustering algorithm that i chose compares very favorably to this underlying distribution. The cUSTOMER SEGMENT 0 that i identified corresponds well to the Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe and the customer segment 1 corresponds well to retailers. In general, I think that these classifications correspond well to what i thought. tHE HOTELS/restaurants/cafes are indeed smaller establishments that dont require loads of groceries but do require fresh food, milk, delicatessen while the retailers are larger businesses that provide groceries and things like detergents_paper.
