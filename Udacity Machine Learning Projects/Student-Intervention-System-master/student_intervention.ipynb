This method also handles errors in the data well and can handle missing values as well. They are well suited for classification problems and are relatively easy to understand and code.\n",

The model is strong in scenarios with clear margins of separation between the data sets and also works well in high dimensional spaces and in cases where the number of samples is lower than the number of dimensions. it is also memory efficient since it uses a subset of data points in the training set. This method is not suitable for large data sets as calculation can be time consuming and it also performs poorly when there is a significant amount of noise in the data.\n",

Ensemble methods are advantageous because they are simple, require few parameters and are very flexible. They also provide a theoratical guarantee that the method wil work and can be good for data sets with high variance. Additionally they work well with high dimensionality and on data sets with large numbers of training examples and on non linear relationships. On the other hand, due to the presence of multiple models, they are computationally expensive, and can be very difficult to interpret.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Adaboost achieves relatively high scores as well. That being said, it also takes the most time for testing predictions. Compared to SVM methods, it is slower at predicting by a factor of 3-4 in most cases and slower in training by a factor of 20-30. SVM scores are slightly higher AND it takes less computing power. I think the board would appreciate the lower computing costs associated with this method. Because of this fact, and the generally high F1 scores, I would recommend this model to the board.\n",

    "If you imagine all of our student data plotted on a chart, with x's representing the students that failed and 0's representing the students that passed, the SVM method is a way of finding a dividing line that separates the x's from the o's. The SVM takes data about past students (age, gender, family, etc), and uses them to create a function that draws a boundary between the students who graduated (o's) and those who did not (x's). The boundary should be drawn so that it separates the failed students form the passing students correctly and should be drawn so as to maximize the distance or \"margin\" between the dividing line and the points.

One of the reasons SVMs are so powerful is that you dont need actually need to draw a line necessarily. one can draw a circle or a squiggle or any other type of dividing line/surface/shape in the data. This is done using what is known as the kernel  trick and is basically a way of converting your data to a higher dimension in which the original non-linear separator becomes linear. Then data can again be separated by a simple dividing line or dividing plane as in the image below. In this way, data sets with lots of parameters can be used to train the separator and make extremely accurate predictions without sacrificing too much computing time.\n",
