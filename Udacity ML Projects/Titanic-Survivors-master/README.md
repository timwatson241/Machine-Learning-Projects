# Titanic-Survivors
Udacity project  - Program to predict survival rates of passengers of the Titanic

In this project, I created decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. I started with a simple algorithm and increased its complexity until I was able to accurately predict the outcomes for the passengers in the data.
