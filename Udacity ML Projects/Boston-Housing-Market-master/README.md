# Boston-Housing-Market
Udacity project - Program to predict house prices in Boston

Project Overview
In this project, I applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. From this, I was able to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compared the predicted selling price to my statistics.

Project Highlights
This project was designed to get me acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn.

Things I learned by completing this project:

How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
How to evaluate a modelâ€™s performance on unseen data using previous data.
